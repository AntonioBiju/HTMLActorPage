<p>Korean traditional fortune telling, or saju palja, dates back thousands of years and remains extremely popular today.
  Saju is the Korean word for “the four pillars of destiny” and it uses statistics and data accumulated over thousands
  of years to characterize a person’s path through life. People consult saju masters for general fortune telling as well
  as for vetting potential marriage partners, finding the luckiest dates for important events, naming one’s baby, or
  even changing one’s own name to attract more good fortune.</p>
